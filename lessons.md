# Lessons from a 12 years failure

## Introduction

The title of this post is more dramatic than the content. As we are closing Tinka (formerly Another Place Productions) I am actually very proud of everything we achieved throughout the journey. But as they say, you learn more from your failures (maybe that is wishful thinking as we certainly have many more than successes!), and I would like to think I got plenty of learnings from it all!

I think it is fair to say we have had one hell of a ride: we made more than a hundred games (okay, a lot of those were hyper casual titles), re-setup the business twice, let go of cofounders twice, and pivoted multiple times. I will not go into details on everything, but I will start by providing some context.

We set up Another Place Productions (APP) in January 2012, after leaving Lionhead Studios (mainly on the Fable franchise with Microsoft). The original founding team had worked there together for many years, and I was very excited to start something up with all of them. My main motivations were to make great games, to be commercially successful, and to contribute where I wanted to (as opposed to being restricted to contributing on technical issues).

Here are the main events of the company's lifetime in chronological order:

* 2012 was spent finding our feet and reshuffling the founding team. Towards the end we decided to focus on mobile free to play
* In 2013 we made Dragon Finga, which attracted 3.5M players
* In 2014 we managed to raise a proper seed round, and focussed on building a team to build mobile RPGs
* BattleHand was largely made in 2015, at the end of which we signed a publishing deal with Kongregate
* We released BattleHand in January 2016 and operated it for 6 years. It was downloaded by ~6.5M players, and generated ~$7M
* In 2017 we started working on a sequel, commissioned and published by Kongregate
* In 2018 BattleHand Heroes was released. The game tanked and we decided to pivot to hyper casual game, letting go of 40% of the staff in the process
* We manage to refinance the business with fresh investment in early 2021. Shortly after we released Fat 2 Fit!, published by Voodoo. The game is downloaded by ~50M players
* Worried that we are not managing to repeat that success, we pivoted to Web3 Gaming in early 2022, and started making a platform to make and publish user interactive stories
* After a pretty bad trip to Slush in November '22, we decided to pivot to core games for browser, and started making Mana Storm (a CCG akin to Hearthstone)

There were very few periods of sustained stability throughout those years: we spent a lot of time and energy trying to raise more capital, as well as sell the business (in a very desperate way, in retrospect).

Around September 2023, we came to the conclusion that we were not going to make it with the resources at our disposal: we were running out of cash pretty fast, and Mana Storm was not working out as we had hoped. We came to the conclusion that it was time to stop the adventure and wind down Tinka: indeed, anything else would only be mere survival, and would only breed more surviving. We felt very strongly that there was no quickfire acqua-hire, and no good chance at building real value for the shareholding group.

I spent a lot of time going over the last 12 years, and what follows are lessons I can draw from that journey (mostly from what has gone wrong). I hope it is useful.

## Communicate well with your board

I have always thought of myself as a good communicator, but the closure of Tinka has made me reflect on this, and I now realise that we (the founders) did not communicate effectively with our board, and more broadly with our investors. In hindsight this has had very serious consequences at various key points.

Firstly, and this is a recurring theme for us, we got into the habit of running everything past our closest advisor and investor before involving anyone else. We were first time founders when we set up APP, and made many mistakes. After about a year we started receiving advice from a well connected business advisor who came highly recommended by close friends (close friends who had successfully exited their business).

This was very welcome, as we felt really down about our ability to run the business effectively, and the road ahead felt very daunting. The effect was that we ended up valuing this individual's opinion much more than anyone else's. Much more damaging was that we actually ended up effectively only listening to him: indeed, as we worked with him so closely, we entered a pattern whereby we would make decisions with him, and then devise how to present it to the other investors and convince them. The consequences were as follows:

- We discarded very valuable input often
- We stopped thinking for ourselves

As it happened, two of the most damaging decisions we made were a direct consequence of this: getting a publishing deal with Kongregate for BattleHand, and pivotting the business to Web3. I will go into more detail regarding both, but suffice to say that we lost $3M as a direct result of those decisions. I now firmly believe that, had we sought advice from everyone invested in the business and trusted our gut more, this would not have happened.

Secondly, and this is compounded by the previous point, we should have made a point to send updates to our board on a frequent and regular basis.

APP was sadly a business that was for much longer in a state of survival than it was thriving. As a result the investor group was largely disengaged for long periods (i.e. once it became apparent that APP had a very low chance of realising a positive outcome). We made the mistake of taking that as an excuse for not engaging with the board either: we would of course update them when key milestones occurred, but nothing more.

One of the most flagrant consequence of this occurred as we decided to close down Tinka: while we regularly informed everyone of the cashflow situation and our difficulties in general, we tended to do it on an individual basis, and never formally. The problem with informal emails is that they are easily ignored, or at least not given the required importance.

As a result, the liquidation process was a more painful experience than it should have been: we feel we quickly lost the trust of the investor group, who quickly became very dissatisfied about how we had proceeded.

Our conclusion is that next time we are company directors we will make sure to formally email the board at least every two weeks, even when there is no particular need to do so. That way, everyone has the opportunity to contribute, and no one can feel out of the loop.

## Find the right founding team

I do not feel I have such good expertise in terms of picking cofounders, but my experience with APP / Tinka still provided me with ample material to reflect upon.

I will start by going over what I believe went wrong, and then will try to draw conclusions. Needless to say, having the right founding team is incredibly important, just as the wrong one is damaging on many levels.

The first mistake we made was to have overlapping specialities. When we setup the initial structure, we had two Technical Directors (including myself) and two de-factor Creative Directors. This can result in confusion as to who is responsible for what, but I think more importantly it is also pointless, and unecessarily costly. After 7 months we were down to three cofounders, and were all the better for it.

Another mistake was to start on uneven footing: we initially split the shares in the following way: 16 / 16 / 16 / 26 / 26. The idea was that a couple of the cofounders had done it all before, and were more key than the rest in terms of getting this business off the ground. In our case it was completely wrong. Their previous experience proved to be irrelevant, and the uneven split only created friction. When I put forward to renegotiate those terms they quickly both left.

Finally, and this is the biggest mistake, APP's founding team from 2013 until 2018 lacked alignment. It lacked business alignment, and it lacked product alignment. Of course disagreements and conflicts are part and parcel of every aspect of life, and are a very healthy part of business, but when there are disagreements on fundamental aspects, it only makes succeeding much, much harder than it should be. What we had during that period is a cofounder who was always at odds with the other two in terms of how the business should operate, as well as which direction should product development go. Again, this created extreme friction in the group and in the company as a whole.

With those in mind, here are the main things I will be looking for next time out:

- Each founder needs to bring something specific to the table that is lacking in the others
- An equal shareholding is a much easier and healthier way to start
- The founding team needs to be aligned. This is tricky to determine in the long run, as a startup situtation often changes, and I think one way to look at it is for the founders to have the same ethos and goals regardless of what the startup is about

## Keep control of your IP

The biggest mistake we made as a studio was, without a doubt, to not self-publish BattleHand.

We started BattleHand towards the end of 2014, and the development process was very painful: we were building the team at the same time, we were fighting creative differences, and we were of course quickly running out of money (which feels crazy as we had just raised our first "real" seed round). We also were struggling with free to play, and our confidence was low. That being said, when we tested the game for the second time in August 2015, the results were very promising, as the game showed good monetisation metrics. In addition, we were very confident to receive a lot of support from Apple and Google, therefore not needing marketing money.

Alas, as money was running out, we took the safe option of a publishing deal with Kongregate. We signed this deal around the end of September '15. Here are the main specifics:

- $500K advance (recoupable on revenue)
- 50/50 split
- No marketing commitment

Now, without wanting to minimise Kongregate's impact on the game, it is fair to say that the metrics never shifted that much. That game had a secret formula (and by secret I mean to us!), and whatever we threw at it did not seem to make that much of a difference, at least in the short term.

When we released the game in January 2016, we were delighted to be global Editor's Choice on iOS, and to have top featuring on Google Play. Again, this was achieved prior to signing the publishing deal, through years of relationship building with Apple folks.

I am guessing we lost around $2M through that deal (the game made around $7M lifetime) as all players came to the game through store featuring. Perhaps more importantly, we lost the opportunity to build on that success, the chance to leverage our product and the commercial opportunities that might have arisen, alongside the associated learnings.

Crucially, we lost our independance, at least in practice. For all intent and purpose we now had a master, and were contractually obliged to work on a product which could not sustain us given the publishing terms. This ultimately resulted in our hyper casual pivot a couple of years and a failed sequel later.

I will go into how and why we made that decision, but as you can tell I firmly believe APP would have had a different trajectory had we kept complete control of BattleHand. As it stands, we turned the servers off in January 2022, as the game stopped being profitable against server costs, with less than 2000 DAU.

## This is a business

It might be obvious to most, and it might be a particularity of the games industry, but this is a business first and foremost. This means that the primary goal is to make money. Unfortunately this was not something that was obvious to us for many years, as it was probably hidden behind other goals, such as making great games or building value towards an exit.

Here are a few times we should have focussed on immediate business concerns:

- Very early in the life of APP we actually had a sniff at a great deal: Sony seemed quite happy to give us $500K to build a prototype, probably as much to stick it to Microsoft as anything else. For some incredibly stupid reason we felt compelled to debate whether this was worth taking or not, as opposed to biting their hand off and making something that probably would have been very cool
- When we got close to release Dragon Finga, it was clear that Apple loved the game

## Raise well

- we often were afraid to ask a lot
- we did not raise enough
- we raised at punitive valuations

## Own your decisions

- BattleHand, again
- Web3 pivot

## Cofounders

- Carters
- John
- Turning down Sony $500K

## Know when to stop

- While we carved some success, would we have been better off stopping earlier?

## Don't do things for pretence

- office
- hiring

## Have a clear business plan

- i.e. how are you going to make money
- be comfortable, don't live on pot noodle
- don't chase a sale when you have nothing

## HIrinig + firign

## Learn from your mistakes
