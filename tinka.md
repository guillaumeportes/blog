# A brief history of Tinka

## Introduction

This is my first post on this blog, and I thought it would be appropriate to make it about the life of our studio, Tinka Games.

I am very proud of what we have achieved, and although we have yet to taste true success, we have had a lot of fun along the way, and worked with awesome people.

## The first year

* Motivation: wanting to influence beyond my discipline (programming), wanting a piece of the pie
* Wrong setup with too many founders, too much hesitation, not enough action, should have taken Sony deal
* End of the year, back to square one

## Dragon Finga

## VC + BattleHand

## BattleHand Heroes
